# Build instructions
Mayo requires Qt5 and OpenCascade &#8805; 7.3.0  
* [Qt installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
* [OpenCascade Download Center](https://old.opencascade.com/content/latest-release)

It uses the `CSF_OCCTIncludePath` and `CSF_OCCTLibPath` environment variables to locate
OpenCascade include and library paths. On Windows these two variables are set by the `env.bat`
script which can be found within OpenCascade's base folder, it is recommended to run this script
and then build Mayo :  
```bash
cd .../mayo
qmake
(n)make
```
In case you don't want to run OpenCascade `env.bat` you can use the `CASCADE_INC_DIR`and `CASCADE_LIB_DIR`
qmake variables instead :  
```bash
qmake "CASCADE_INC_DIR=occ_include_dir" "CASCADE_LIB_DIR=occ_library_dir"
```
